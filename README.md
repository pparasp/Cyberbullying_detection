The Cyberbullying Detection System is an AI-powered application designed to identify and classify online harassment, abuse, or bullying across digital communication platforms. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques, this system analyzes textual content such as comments, tweets, or messages to detect toxic or offensive language patterns.

The goal is to promote a safer online environment by flagging harmful content and assisting moderators or platform owners in taking appropriate actions.

🚀 Features

🔍 Text Analysis: Detects offensive, hateful, and bullying language.

🧠 Machine Learning Model: Trained on labeled datasets of social media comments.

📊 Multi-Class Classification: Categorizes text into hate speech, offensive language, or neutral.

🌐 Web Interface (Optional): Simple user interface for input and detection results.

🧾 Real-Time Prediction: Provides instant feedback for entered text.

💾 Data Preprocessing: Includes tokenization, stopword removal, stemming, and vectorization.

🧩 Technologies Used

Python 3

Scikit-learn / TensorFlow / PyTorch (for model building)

Pandas & NumPy (for data manipulation)

NLTK / spaCy (for text preprocessing)

Flask / FastAPI / Streamlit (for deployment or UI)

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

⚙️ How It Works

Data Collection: Collect comments/posts from platforms like Twitter, Reddit, or open datasets.

Preprocessing: Clean text by removing URLs, punctuation, emojis, and converting to lowercase.

Feature Extraction: Convert text into numerical vectors using TF-IDF, Bag of Words, or Word Embeddings.

Model Training: Train a classification model (e.g., Logistic Regression, SVM, LSTM).

Prediction: Classify new text as Cyberbullying or Non-Cyberbullying.

Evaluation: Evaluate model using precision, recall, F1-score, and accuracy.

🧠 Example Use Case

Input:

"You are such a loser, nobody likes you!"

Output:

⚠️ Detected: Cyberbullying (Harassment / Insult)
